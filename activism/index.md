Some presumptuous tips on making a difference.

## On Fixing The World
Many of us have an innate desire to fix many of the things we *see wrong* in the universe, but it's worth taking some pause to consider some obvious truths about this feeling.

1. Stop and think about this -- You cannot fix *everything*. Pick your fights!
2. Your level of effort in wanting and trying to fix *Issue X* **ought to** match the level of __control__ and *influence* that you have *over Issue X*. Taking too big a bite can choke you. 
3. The very *great majority* of issues in this universe are *outside* your control. So *Hey, Jude, refrain, don't carry the world upon your shoulders.*
4. Your level of *control* actually lies in a *spectrum* from low to high, or, if you prefer, high to low.
5. For issues where you have a high level of control and influence, you have *no excuses* for **NOT** trying to fix them.
    - Seriously, you should feel *shame* for not trying to fix them ðŸ˜€
    - And you should study these issues in-depth
    - And you should have a stance on how you feel about each of them
    - Try to think of possible solutions and fixes
6. For issues where you have a low level of control and influence, you actually have a very *legitimate* excuse for not being able to correct them.
    - So, for most of these, just *let them go*!
    - Still, do try a bit to *understand* them, again proportionally to your sphere of influence
    - Do try a bit to be *informed* on them
    - Do try a bit to have a *stance* on them
7. Not everything that we *see as wrong* may actually be wrong. Double and triple check whether *Issue X* is really a problem that is really worth solving.
