# Arcade
Tips on playing the old-style coin-operated video arcade games. You can buy the actual old game cabinets from eBay and other places. Or you can set up [MAME](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAME) on your desktop, using game ROMs you legally own. Or you can build you own game cabinet, with a small dedicated computer running running MAME.

## MAME on Your Desktop
MAME originally stood for Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator, but nowadays it means much more than that. As its website states: 

    MAME is a hardware emulator: it faithfully reproduces the behavior of many
    arcade machines (it is not a simulation). This program is not a game but can
    directly, through ROM images, run the complete system of these old arcade
    machines. These ROMs are subject to copyright and it is in most of the cases
    illegal to use them if you do not own the arcade machine.

To set up MAME, do the following:
- Install the latest MAME binary using your OS package installer. On macOS you can just do `brew install mame`
- Copy the ROM zip files into the `~/.mame/roms/` directory
- Run any specific game from the CLI with `mame stargate`
- Install [`manu`](https://github.com/git719/manu), a small Go util that reads above roms directory and prompts for what game to run 

Read more in the [MAME Reference](https://docs.mamedev.org/index.html).

## MAME on Raspberry Pi

- Install Ubuntu 24.04 desktop on Raspberry Pi 5
- This assumes you're using Apple **macOS** to do all this
- Use an SD card of at least 16GB in size
- Insert the SD card on your Mac
- `brew install raspberry-pi-imager`
- Run the Imager and burn the latest Ubuntu Desktop image
- Once done, insert the SD card on your Pi5 and install Ubuntu
  
### Ideal Arcade Monitor
The ideal arcade computer monitor is the **ViewSonic** 4/3 aspect ratio **VG939Sm** monitor. The Model No = VS15843.

### Additional configurations and settings follow below

Below are some general guidelines and configuration settings for such a setup, but you'll need to improvise where necessary.

#### Adjust CLI Console Character size

```bash
sudo mount -o remount,rw /boot/firmware
sudo vi /boot/firmware/cmdline.txt
Remove the 'quiet splash' at the end, and add 'video=800x600' or 1024x768 ; 1280x720 ; 1920x1080
sudo vi /boot/firmware/config.txt
Add below
hdmi_group=2
hdmi_mode=16  # 9=800x600 ; 16=1024x768 ; 4=1280x720 ; 82=1920x1080
dtparam=pciex1_gen=2
```

If necessary, you can make further adjustments via `dpkg-reconfigure` utility: 

```bash
sudo apt install console-setup kbd   # To optionally install addtional Font Sizes
sudo dpkg-reconfigure console-setup
Select Terminus                      # Default is VGA
Select Font Size 8x14, or whatever
```

#### Setup SSH

```bash
sudo systemctl enable ssh
sudo systemctl start ssh
```

#### Disable desktop

```bash
sudo systemctl set-default multi-user.target
sudo reboot
sudo systemctl start graphical.target        # To manually start the Graphical Desktop
sudo systemctl set-default graphical.target  # To re-enable Graphical Desktop
```

#### Auto-login setup

To set default user for automatic login, edit the getty service: 

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/getty@tty1.service.d/
sudo vi /etc/systemd/system/getty@tty1.service.d/override.conf

Add below:

[Service]
ExecStart=
ExecStart=-/sbin/agetty --autologin USERNAME --noclear %I $TERM

# Note: Replace USERNAME with the actual username

sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart getty@tty1.service
sudo reboot
```

#### Issues
- If keyboard does not respond when the **manu** menu comes up, ensure that the user you're running all this under has the correct permissions by doing `sudo usermod -a -G input $USER`

### Set New Hostname

```bash
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname <NEW-HOSTNAME>
sudo vi /etc/hosts  # Change it here too
sudo reboot
```

### Ensure Sound is Working

Plug a USB-to-3.5mm audio connector to the Raspberry Pi 5 and connect that to your speakers. Test with below steps: 

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install --reinstall pipewire pipewire-pulse wireplumber pipewire-audio-client-libraries
sudo apt install --reinstall libspa-0.2-bluetooth
pactl info | grep "Server Name"
pactl list short sinks
aplay /usr/share/sounds/alsa/Front_Center.wav  # To test speaker
```

### Install MAME

To download and install the latest MAME binary. Use the binaries located at <https://stickfreaks.com/>. Note that they use **7 Zip** for compression. Note also, that this setup puts certain binaries under the `$HOME/bin/` directory.

```bash
cd ~/bin
curl -LO https://stickfreaks.com/mame/mame_0.281_debian_13_trixie_arm64.7z
sudo apt install 7zip
7z x mame_0.281_debian_13_trixie_arm64.7z -omame_0.281
ln -sf mame_0.281/mame mame
```

So the **mame** binary will reside at `$HOME/bin/mame`, and remember that the standard MAME configurations normally reside under the `$HOME/.mame` directory.

### Compile MAME?

If you decide to compile MAME yourself, which allows you to select only the machines you are interested in, follow below instructions.

#### Install required packages and clone MAME repo 

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential libsdl2-dev libfontconfig1-dev libpulse-dev \
  qtbase5-dev qtchooser qt5-qmake qtbase5-dev-tools libqt5opengl5-dev \
  libasound2-dev libxinerama-dev libxi-dev libgl1-mesa-dev python3
sudo apt install libsdl2-ttf-dev

git clone https://github.com/mamedev/mame.git
cd mame
```

#### Initial Compilation

You will need to do a **full compilation** first, in roder to build the needed `emu.h` and other core headers. This ***can take a long time**: 

```bash
time make clean
rm -rf obj
time make SUBTARGET=mame SOURCES="src/mame/skeleton/testpat.cpp" REGENIE=1 NOWERROR=1 -j$(nproc)
```

Note that `emu.h` and the `.pch` files arenâ€™t part of the source tree, and they are ONLY generated during a **full regular build**. This pre-step is a requirement in order to later do a restricted SOURCES build of a "tiny" MAME binary with only selected games.

#### Prepare Source Files

From the root of the checked out `mame` directory: 

```bash
$ cat src/mame/custom/custom.mak
# Custom build for specific games

SOURCES += src/mame/capcom/1942.cpp
SOURCES += src/mame/namco/galaga.cpp
SOURCES += src/mame/pacman/pacman.cpp
SOURCES += src/mame/midway/williams.cpp

$ cat src/mame/custom.lst
@source:capcom/1942.cpp
1942            // (c) Capcom

@source:namco/galaga.cpp
galaga          // (c) Namco
galagamf        // (c) Namco
galagamk        // (c) Namco

@source:pacman/pacman.cpp
mspacman        // (c) Namco/Midway

@source:midway/williams.cpp
stargate        // (c) Williams
```

#### Tiny Compilation

```bash
time make SUBTARGET=mame SOURCES="src/mame/capcom/1942.cpp,src/mame/namco/galaga.cpp,src/mame/pacman/pacman.cpp,src/mame/midway/williams.cpp" REGENIE=1 NOWERROR=1 OPTIMIZE=3 USE_QTDEBUG=1 -j$(nproc)

# Confirm version and list of supported games
./mame -version
./mame -listfull
```

### Boot into manu Binary

Boot into default `manu` Game Menu binary - See <https://github.com/git719/manu>

You may also want to update your `$HOME/.bashrc` file with below snippet, so that this special menu utility always run: 

```bash
# Always run manu menu binary. See https://github.com/git719/manu
while true; do
    manu
done
```

### Configure MAME USB Controller

Before configuring MAME, make sure the OS is able to read the joystick controller and buttons:

```bash
sudo apt-get install joystick
jstest /dev/input/js0
# Then press the buttons and joystick controls to confirm
```

Once you know the OS is able to read the controller, configure it **within** MAME itself by pressing **TAB** from an attached keyboard, and MAME will allow you to configure the buttons accordingly. For more info see the [MAME documenation pages](https://docs.mamedev.org/index.html).


## Creating USB Installers

- Download the desired ISO using `curl -LO` (see below).
- You will need an empty USB drive of 16GB or more in size.
- Create the USB using below instructions, which are for macOS, and therefore require the ISO be converted to DMG format: 

```bash
curl -LO https://github.com/substring/os/releases/download/2023.11/groovyarcade-2023.11-x86_64.iso.xz
xz -d groovyarcade-2023.11-x86_64.iso.xz
hdiutil convert groovyarcade-2023.11-x86_64.iso -format UDRW -o groovyarcade-2023.11-x86_64
diskutil list 
diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk4
sudo dd status=progress bs=1m if=groovyarcade-2023.11-x86_64.dmg of=/dev/rdisk4
diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk4
```

Now remove USB from your Mac, and in short, you'll need to:

- Ensure that the target system allows booting off of a USB drive
- Insert USB into target system and follow the OS installation instructions
