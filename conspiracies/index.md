## How to Deprogram a Conspiracy Theorist

* **Problem**
  * Remember, we are just _primates_ so we **all** _suffer_ from the same imperfect brain circuits
  * Some of us see things with a bit more clarity, but be humble, others are less fortunate
    * Less educated
    * Have a powerful desire to _feel special_
    * Feel a strong sense of _powerlessness_
    * Have a need for _certainty_
  * Many beliefs are _inextricably_ tied to our **identity** &mdash; becoming part of who we _are_ 
  * **You cannot talk some people out of it!**
    * Conspiracies meme are _designed_ to _resist_ this!
* **Solution**
  * You're in a toxic **tent** if/when you argue with them
  * **You** have to _step outside_ of the tent
  * **Always** speak respectfully &mdash; don't mock or ridicule or patronize
  * Connect over shared interests and experiences to establish _raport_
    * This is your biggest asset
  * Help them take concrete action in pursuit of their goals
  * Help them focus on how to **improve** their future
  * More _control_ equals _fewer_ conspiracy theories
  * Keep talking about _their goals_ and help them understand the steps to take to get there
  * Empower and help them make their _own_ decisions
  * Ask good _questions_, and especially, **give them time to respond**
  * If and **only if** they are _open_, provide them with **truth sandwiches**: 
    * A **fact**, then the **fallacy**, followed by a **fact** 
* **Notes**
  * The challenge is that **you alone** are then competing with **massive** resources that are feeding the problem
  * You alone cannot win them over. The obscenely lucrative Social Media _user engagement_ business model is too much competition!
  * Become more active to get governments to regulate _misinformation_
    * For example, there are [bipartisan efforts in Congress](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/08/25/congressmen-bipartisan-resolution-condemning-qanon-401606) to declared **Q'Anon** as a "dangerous, anti-Semitic, conspiracy-mongering cult."
  * We need the First Amendment so **regulate** them, not ban them
