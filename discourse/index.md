# Discourse
Based on the ideas of experts like [Rogers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Rogers), [Popper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Popper), [Rapoport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatol_Rapoport), [Dennett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Dennett), and others in this field, we can say that people have mostly figured out __how to argue properly__.

This is a straightforward suggestion to improve your discussions and make them more fruitful and enjoyable.

## Discourse Protocol
For more productive and enjoyable discussions try following the Discourse Protocol (DP):

  1. *Do not* proceed until all sides agree on below simple list:
     <ol style="list-style-type: lower-latin">
     <li>Pick an appropriate time and place for the exchange</li>
     <li>Be ready to tolerate criticism</li>
     <li>Choose to <b>pause</b> or even <b>end</b> the debate at any time</li>
     </ol>
  2. Listen attentively and make the other side feel understood.
  3. Be humble and ask honest questions to seek understanding.
  4. Really think about the idea that you could be wrong and the other side could be right.
  5. Talk things over rationally, preferably using <a href="https://que.tips/science/">science</a>.
  6. Agreement is comparatively unimportant, as both side could easily be mistaken.
  7. Repeat items #1 through #6 until any party enacts Item #1c.

Also, as Dennet points out, when you try to explain what the other side thinks, make it so clear that they might say, "Thanks, I wish I had said it like that!"

Finally, you could also think about having casual chats later, where you can talk about what you learned from the discussion in a more laid-back way.
