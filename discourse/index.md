# Discourse
A simple tip for improving discussions and making them more fruitful and enjoyable.

Based on the ideas of experts like [Rogers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Rogers), [Popper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Popper), [Rapoport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatol_Rapoport), [Dennett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Dennett), and others in this field, we can say that people have mostly figured out __how to argue properly__ with other **_reasonable_** people.

When talking with most people, it's important to keep in mind that not everyone is **_reasonable_**. Some people, for various reasons, such as believing in [pseudoscience](../pseudoscience), may not be open to discussion. In situations like these, it's best to avoid trying to have rational conversations altogether.

## Discourse Protocol
For productive and enjoyable discussions try following the Discourse Protocol (DP):

1. *Do not* proceed until all sides agree on below simple list:
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-latin">
    <li>An appropriate time and place for the exchange</li>
    <li>Be ready to tolerate criticism</li>
    <li>Choose to <b>pause</b> or even <b>end</b> the debate at any time</li>
    </ol>
2. Follow below simple guidelines:
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-latin">
    <li>Listen attentively and make the other side feel understood</li>
    <li>As Dennet points out, when you try to explain what the other side thinks, make it so clear that they might say, "Thanks, I wish I had said it like that!"</li>
    <li>Be humble and ask honest questions to seek understanding</li>
    <li>Talk things over rationally, preferably using <a href="https://que.tips/science/">science</a></li>
    <li>Really think about the idea that you could be wrong and the other side could be right</li>
    <li>Remember that agreement is comparatively unimportant, as both side could easily be mistaken (<a href="https://que.tips/discourse/popper/">Karl Popper</a>)</li>
    </ol>
3. Repeat items #1 and #2 until any party enacts Item #1c
