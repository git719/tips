# Discourse
Tips on how to have better collaborative discussions and rational debates.

A better dialogue can be achieved by following the Discourse Protocol (DP) below, which is a simple numbered list of personalized dictums that can be universally followed by sentient beings to solve intellectual differences. 

## Discourse Protocol (DP)
  1. Must try to follow these key requirements
     <ol style="list-style-type: lower-latin">
     <li>Appropriate time and place for the exchange</li>
     <li>Mutual, honest, serious respect to learning</li>
     <li>It is Ok for any party to **pause** or even **end** the debate at **any** time</li>
     <li>Aim for highest approximation to the truth</li>
     <li>Use [science](https://que.tips/science/) to acquire knowledge</li>
     <li>Avoid the temptation to force agreement; appreciating that the other side may be more important</li>
     <li>Admit that agreement may only come years later, *if at all*</li>       
     </ol>
  2. If above requirements are missing, don't give up! Send this link, asking if *other side* would like to agree to them.
  3. If at any point you sense an infringement of Item #1, say so and **do not** continue until all parties are in agreement on Item #1.
  4. Follow the Rogerian, Rapoport, Dennet **Rules of Debate** below.
  5. Try to be humble and ask questions to seek understanding.
  6. Repeat items #1 through #5 until any party enacts Item #1c.

## Rules of Debate
Humanity has largely solved the problem of how to argue properly! We just need the self-discipline to follow the proven advice.

Please follow what Wikipedia describes as [a Rogerian argument (or Rogerian rhetoric), a rhetorical and conflict resolution strategy based on empathizing with others, seeking common ground and mutual understanding and learning, while avoiding the negative effects of extreme attitude polarization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogerian_argument).

*Please read the tips on this page; the listed Wikipedia articles, and other relevant notes below to better understand how this is done.*

The advice starts by detailing below key points of the [Anatol Rapoport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatol_Rapoport) Rogerian [strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogerian_argument#Rapoport's_rules) in ethical debates.
  1. Listening and making the other feel understood
  2. Finding some merit in the other's position
  3. Increasing perceived similarity

Philopher [Daniel Dennett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Dennett) coined these pricipals as "*Rapoport's rules of debate*" [1] and [rephrased them to be more 'portable and versatile'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogerian_argument#Dennett's_version) as:
  1. You should attempt to re-express your target's position so clearly, vividly, and fairly that your target says, 'Thanks, I wish I'd thought of putting it that way.'
  2. You should list any points of agreement (especially if they are not matters of general or widespread agreement).
  3. You should mention anything you have learned from your target.
  4. Only then are you permitted to say so much as a word of rebuttal or criticism.

Note that Dennett deliberately uses the charged word 'your target' to account for folks who do not adhered to what we here call DP Item #1. A more neutral phrase would be 'the other', as used in the Rogerian strategy.
