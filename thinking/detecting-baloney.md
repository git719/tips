# Detecting Baloney

Some tips for how to detect **baloney** (foolish words or ideas that are nonsensical or absurd). This ought to be part of every person's *intellectual self-defense toolkit*.

- Listen to or read folks like the late [Carl Sagan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Sagan) and [Michael Shermer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Shermer)
- A good starting point is [Carl Sagan's Baloney Detection Kit](https://themindcollection.com/baloney-detection-kit/)
- Two other great video clips are **[Michael Shermer 1](https://youtu.be/mn7jVTGjb-I)** and [Michael Shermer 2](https://youtu.be/aNSHZG9blQQ)
- **But** be careful with [YouTUBE](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=baloney+detection+kit) and other social media algorithms in general - they can be **emotionally** loaded, depending on the topic
- Build your own list of trusted sources instead of relying on whatever the algorithm serves
- Cross-check claims with multiple credible outlets before accepting them
- (There are many others ...)
