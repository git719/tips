# Basic Biases

I ran into below table while reading below from [Steve Stewart-Williams](https://www.stevestewartwilliams.com/p/one-bias-to-rule-them-all):

"... a fascinating recent paper by Aileen Oeberst and Roland Imhoff argues that all our cognitive biases boil down to one of a handful of fundamental beliefs, coupled with just one '*ultimate*' bias. The fundamental beliefs include such ideas as '*I make correct assessments*' and '*I am good*'." And the ultimate bias is **[confirmation bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias)**: the tendency to seek and favor information consistent with oneâ€™s preexisting views."
