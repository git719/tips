# Scripts
Useful shell scripts that can be called and run by copying the `runner` script locally, then renaming it as the script you want to call here. For instance, to run `buildgo` locally, download the `runner` script and rename it `buildgo`. When you run `buildgo` locally it will download and run the version here.

The advantage of this methodology is that you are always running the latest version of the script. To view the actual, raw script, you can click on the respective link.

| Script Name | Version    | Comment               |

| [buildgo](./buildgo) | 1.0.1      | Generic script to compile Go programs |
| [genindex](./genindex) | 1.0.0      | Generates this table of scripts here |
| [runner](./runner) | 1.0.4      | Runner script to run scripts hosted here |
| [webm2mp4](./webm2mp4) | 1.0.0      | Converts WEBM format files to MP4 format |
