# Scripts
Useful shell scripts.

These can easily be called and run locally, by simply copying the `runner` script below, renaming it to the script you want to call from below list. For instance, to run `build_go`, download `runner` and rename it to `build_go`. Then when you run `build_go` locally it will download and run the version hosted here.

The advantage of this methodology is that you are always running _the latest version of the script_.
