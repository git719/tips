## Scripts
Useful shell scripts.

To use a script, download it locally by clicking on its respective link below. You can then run the script from its download location or move it to a directory in your system's PATH for easier access. All scripts include a `check_version()` function, which checks if you're running the latest version available on this site. You can also view the source code of these scripts directly on [Github](https://github.com/git719/tips/tree/main/scripts).
